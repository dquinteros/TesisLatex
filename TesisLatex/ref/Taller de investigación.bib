abstract = {Segmentation and tracking of multiple humans in crowded situations is made difficult by interobject occlusion. We propose a model based approach to interpret the image observations by multiple, partially occluded human hypotheses in a Bayesian framework. We define a joint image likelihood for multiple humans based on the appearance of the humans, the visibility of body obtained by occlusion reasoning, and foreground/background separation. The optimal solution is obtained by using an efficient sampling method, data-driven Markov chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC), which uses image observations for proposal probabilities. Knowledge of various aspects including human shape, camera model, and image cues are integrated in one theoretically sound framework. We present experimental results and quantitative evaluation, demonstrating that the resulting approach is effective for very challenging data.},

abstract = {Given two to four synchronized video streams taken at eye level and from different angles, we show that we can effectively combine a generative model with dynamic programming to accurately follow up to six individuals across thousands of frames in spite of significant occlusions and lighting changes. In addition, we also derive metrically accurate trajectories for each one of them. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate that our generative model can effectively handle occlusions in each time frame independently, even when the only data available comes from the output of a simple background subtraction algorithm and when the number of individuals is unknown a priori. Second, we show that multi-person tracking can be reliably achieved by processing individual trajectories separately over long sequences, provided that a reasonable heuristic is used to rank these individuals and avoid confusing them with one another.},

abstract = {This thesis targets the detection of humans and other object classes in images and videos. Our focus is on developing robust feature extraction algorithms that encode image regions as highdimensional feature vectors that support high accuracy object/non-object decisions. To test our feature sets we adopt a relatively simple learning framework that uses linear Support Vector Machines to classify each possible image region as an object or as a non-object. The approach is data-driven and purely bottom-up using low-level appearance and motion vectors to detect objects. As a test case we focus on person detection as people are one of the most challenging object classes with many applications, for example in film and video analysis, pedestrian detection for smart cars and video surveillance. Nevertheless we do not make any strong class specific assumptions and the resulting object detection framework also gives state-of-the-art performance for many other classes including cars, motorbikes, cows and sheep. This thesis makes four main contributions. Firstly, we introduce grids of locally normalised Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as descriptors for object detection in static images. The HOG descriptors are computed over dense and overlapping grids of spatial blocks, with image gradient orientation features extracted at fixed resolution and gathered into a highdimensional feature vector. They are designed to be robust to small changes in image contour locations and directions, and significant changes in image illumination and colour, while remaining highly discriminative for overall visual form. We show that unsmoothed gradients, fine orientation voting, moderately coarse spatial binning, strong normalisation and overlapping blocks are all needed for good performance. Secondly, to detect moving humans in videos, we propose descriptors based on oriented histograms of differential optical flow. These are similar to static HOG descriptors, but instead of image gradients, they are based on local differentials of dense optical flow. They encode the noisy optical flow estimates into robust feature vectors in a manner that is robust to the overall camera motion. Several variants are proposed, some capturing motion boundaries while others encode the relative motions of adjacent image regions. Thirdly, we propose a general method based on kernel density estimation for fusing multiple overlapping detections, that takes into account the number of detections, their confidence scores and the scales of the detections. Lastly, we present work in progress on a parts based approach to person detection that first detects local body parts like heads, torso, and legs and then fuses them to create a global overall person detector.},
