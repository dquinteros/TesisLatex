abstract = {This thesis targets the detection of humans and other object classes in images and videos. Our focus is on developing robust feature extraction algorithms that encode image regions as highdimensional feature vectors that support high accuracy object/non-object decisions. To test our feature sets we adopt a relatively simple learning framework that uses linear Support Vector Machines to classify each possible image region as an object or as a non-object. The approach is data-driven and purely bottom-up using low-level appearance and motion vectors to detect objects. As a test case we focus on person detection as people are one of the most challenging object classes with many applications, for example in film and video analysis, pedestrian detection for smart cars and video surveillance. Nevertheless we do not make any strong class specific assumptions and the resulting object detection framework also gives state-of-the-art performance for many other classes including cars, motorbikes, cows and sheep. This thesis makes four main contributions. Firstly, we introduce grids of locally normalised Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as descriptors for object detection in static images. The HOG descriptors are computed over dense and overlapping grids of spatial blocks, with image gradient orientation features extracted at fixed resolution and gathered into a highdimensional feature vector. They are designed to be robust to small changes in image contour locations and directions, and significant changes in image illumination and colour, while remaining highly discriminative for overall visual form. We show that unsmoothed gradients, fine orientation voting, moderately coarse spatial binning, strong normalisation and overlapping blocks are all needed for good performance. Secondly, to detect moving humans in videos, we propose descriptors based on oriented histograms of differential optical flow. These are similar to static HOG descriptors, but instead of image gradients, they are based on local differentials of dense optical flow. They encode the noisy optical flow estimates into robust feature vectors in a manner that is robust to the overall camera motion. Several variants are proposed, some capturing motion boundaries while others encode the relative motions of adjacent image regions. Thirdly, we propose a general method based on kernel density estimation for fusing multiple overlapping detections, that takes into account the number of detections, their confidence scores and the scales of the detections. Lastly, we present work in progress on a parts based approach to person detection that first detects local body parts like heads, torso, and legs and then fuses them to create a global overall person detector.},

@article{Dollar2012,
abstract = {Pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision, with several applications that have the potential to positively impact quality of life. In recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. However, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. To address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. We make three primary contributions: 1) We put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. Our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. In particular, detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians.},
